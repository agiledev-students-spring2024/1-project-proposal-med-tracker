### Project title

Med Tracker

### What and why?

In the current society, each person takes on multiple social roles and responsibilities, leaving little time for self-care and health management. For people taking multiple medications/drugs at different times in a day, it is hard to remember to take each one on time. It's also difficult for elder patients to keep track of each medication, especially for those with fading memories. Therefore, I aim to create a lightweight all-in-one application that allows users to enter the names of the medications and time of the day they need to take it, along with a picture of the medications. It will be on a mobile system such that people will get the reminder whenever and whereever they are.  

### For whom?

The software is built for users who need to take medications on a regular basis. It's especially friendly for users who has trouble managing multiple kinds to medications, where the software will have notifications for time to take medicine at the pre-set time of the day. It's also friendly for patients with fading memories, where a picture of the medications will be along side its name, easier for those having trouble matching the medications with their names.

### How?

1. Users will create their own accounts by registering with username and password. They can then access their private accounts by logging in with their username and password.

2. Users will be able to create a list of applications they're taking currently, by searching in the database that includes most of the medications. For each entry of the medication, users will include medicine's name, picture, the amount to take each time, the total amount of that specific medications they currently have (e.g. 2 bottles) and the interval/ time they need to take each one.

3. Users will be able to modify their list of medications, including adding a new medicine, deleting an existing medicine, or editing a current medicine by changing the amount or time for taking the medicine. 

4. Users will be notified at different times of the day, according to the schedule, that it's time to take a specific medicine. Users will be able to mark on the list, indicating that they have taken the medicine. If users don't mark it as complete, notifications will be given on regular basis as a reminder.

5. Users will be notified when a medicine they're taking is almost running out, according to the calculation of the software.

### Scope

The system is straightforward and clear, which consists of a database of medications and each user's information. It will be manageable for a group to complete for 4-6 programmers in this semester. If the project is completed faster than planned, additional features can be added to the software to enrich the usage. Additional features include a suggesting system that shows the nearby pharmacies available for purchasing a specific medicine when it's about to run out. Otherwise, the software can also be split into physicians and patient versions, where the physicians can directly assign medicines to patients and patients will also be able to create or add medications themselves.
